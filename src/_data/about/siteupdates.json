I don't like how neocities won't update the index through the CLI, so I figure a static (but hopefully) interesting splash screen will be a good workaround. I also added a tentative 'clear everything locally, rebuild it, delete the neocities site, and push the new one' command. Will test it out once I get the splash screen sort of finalized.

Installing was a bit of a pain, but I can now run a few npm commands to rebuild the site and push it to Neocities. Next steps (eventually) will be to combine the commands, so I can delete the old site / rebuild it in one command, then clear the neocities site / push the new site. Babysteps!","image":""},

So far I have a series of cards that will link out to other pages. I'm setting it up so there will be one hub page that links out to others, with each page being dedicated to a specific medium. Not sure how I want to include notes / learnings... However, there may be something in 11ty that will let me set them up as a blog, then use tags to decide which page to render them too. We'll see!","image":""},{"year":"2024","date":"2/26/2024","entry":"The initial bits of this website are up and running!
